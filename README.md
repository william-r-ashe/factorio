This contains blueprint books for personal use in Factorio. The current books are:

### Basics

Most of what you need to get a good base going through rocket launch. Basic upgradeable designs for all major outputs, balancers, helper layouts for early game.

### City Blocks

Designs for a larger base built around 100x100 city blocks, including decentralized production, network controlled trains, etc.
