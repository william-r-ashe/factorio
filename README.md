# Factorio Helpers

This contains helper tools for personal use in Factorio. It may include updates of my own, 
but has also been largely drawn from the following creators:

- [raynquist Balancer Book](https://github.com/raynquist/balancer)
- [Nilaus Master Class Blueprints](https://nilaus.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PM/pages/2852782081/Factorio+-+Master+Class+Blueprints)
